This is a single cycle RISC-V datapath implementation supporting all RV32I except for: jal, jalr, fence, ecall, ebreak (making total of 35 instructions).
Basic testcase is provided, it is not thoroughly tested though. The testcase is loaded in the instruction memory, and is provided as an assembly text and binary text as well.
This implementation uses distinct instruction and data memories.
